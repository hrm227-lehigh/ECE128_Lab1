# ECE128_Lab1

This lab involved designing and testing an 8-to-1 multiplexor using three different styles of module construction: structural, behavioral, and dataflow.
The code in this repository includes all modules designed and the testbench needed to emulate our results. 
The procedure for this lab was conducted by Cesar Islas Espinosa and Hardhik Mandadi.

The FPGA implementation consisted of 8 input switches as well as 3 selector switches. The selector switches s0 s1 and s2, can be used to switch on a 3 bit number from 0 to 7. The input switch corresponding to the 3 bit value can be switched on to turn on the output LED.
