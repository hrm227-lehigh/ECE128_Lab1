# ECE128_Lab1

This lab involved designing and testing an 8-to-1 multiplexor using three different styles of module construction: structural, behavioral, and dataflow.
The code in this repository includes all modules designed and the testbench needed to emulate our results. 
The procedure for this lab was conducted by Cesar Islas Espinosa and Hardhik Mandadi.
